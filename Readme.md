# Calculation Correct #

Simple and Stupid C function to print a "Calculation Correct" / 
"Calculation Incorrect" to the terminal. Inspired in the movie
"The Martian" and pseudo-ported from python from
[CalcCorrect](https://github.com/hsocasnavarro/CalcCorrect)

There's simply a function called `calculation_correct` which
receives a boolean, true for "Correct", false for "Incorrect"
